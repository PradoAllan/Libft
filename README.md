## WELCOME!

> _Hi! Hope you are doing great! 
This is my first project from my common core journey, as a cadet, at 42 RIO._

> _The main proposal of this project is to create my own C library with some basic functions, like: strlen, split, join and some others importants functions. This project is very important because it will be the library that I'm going to use for the rest of the common core._ 

> _To develop the 34 mandatory functions + 9 bonus functions (linked list), I had to study how does the original functions works, and make my own version of them. But, the most important part is that, the ones that I make, has to behave the same way as the original one._ 

> _Every line of code was made in C._

### Functions

* [`ft_isascii`](ft_isascii.c)		- Test for ASCII character.
* [`ft_isalnum`](ft_isalnum.c)		- Test for alphanumeric character.
